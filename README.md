# Astronaut Timelines Using Machine Learning
A python and HTML project that creates a timeline of astronauts' lives while on the International Space Station. This project uses images from the public ISS Flickr page and detects astronauts in images, using the face_recognition python library. Each astronaut is given a 'timeline' and info page on an HTML website, with the timeline containing images of them on the space station sorted by date.

### Getting Started
Open the home.html file in /html to visit our web page showing each astronaut. From there, click on an astronaut to see images they appear in during their time in the ISS, as well as their biography.

### Face Recognition Prerequisites
To run FaceRecognition.py for yourself, install the following python libraries:
* dlib
* cmake
* face_recognition
* numpy
* opencv-python

### Other Prerequisites
Other libraries required for pulling data from Flickr, Wikipedia, and more are listed below
* beautifulsoup4
* requests
* wikipedia

### Built With
* python
* HTML
* CSS

### Future Developments
* Create dynamic pages for each astronaut using Javascript
* Store timeline information in database
* Use Flickr API to grab photos and details
