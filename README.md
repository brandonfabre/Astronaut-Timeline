# Astronaut-Timeline
A python, HTML, and SQLite3 project that creates a timeline of astronauts' lives while on the International Space Station. This project uses images from the public ISS Flickr page and detects astronauts in images, using the face_recognition python library. Each astronaut is given a 'timeline' and info page on an HTML website, with the timeline containing images of them on the space station sorted by date.
